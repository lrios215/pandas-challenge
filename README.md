## PyCitySchools

City's school district analysis of math and reading testing scores. 


## Overall Trends
Overall Trends in school performance:

* DISTRICTWIDE:
    * On average, students out performed in reading over math. 85.81% passed reading with a score of 70 or 
    higher, while 74.98% passed math with a score of 70 or higher (see District Summary table).
* SCHOOL TYPE: 
    * All charter schools out performed all district schools in both math and reading % passing with a 
    70 or higher (see Scores by School Type table).  
* SCHOOL SIZE:
    * Top 5 performing schools are all charter schools with less than 2300 students.  Bottom 5 performing 
    schools are all district schools with more than 2300 students.  So small to medium (<2000) schools out 
    performed larger schools (2000-5000) (see Top and Bottom Performing Schools tables).
* GRADE LEVEL: 
    * Students scored similarly in 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th in both math and reading, grade level does 
    not appear to impact testing score (see Math and Reading Scores by Grade tables).
* PER STUDENT BUDGET:
    * Spending per student and test scores do not appear to correlate.  
    * Schools that had a lower per student budget (<$585 per student) had a higher overall passing rate in 
    both math and reading.  Whereas, schools with a higher per student budget ($645-$655) had a lower 
    overall passing rate in both math and reading (see Scores by School Spending table)
